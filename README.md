This is the code for my personal website / art gallery. 

Futurism is my most recent work where I'm transitioning away from nature photography. the music in the gallery is Kyoto Bells
by Jim Hall, my favorite jazz guitarist. :) Thank you to Devra Hall Levy, Jim's daughter, who kindly let me use the music 
for the gallery. 

Life and Love was my work from 2016-2017, primarily nature photography with some abstract elements. The music featured is a
solo piano piece called Apart by Kendall Miles, one of my favorite new musicians. I made the album cover for the song and
is actually featured in Vibrations.

Vibrations is a collection of album art work pieces that I've made, including J'san, Kendall Miles, and Jeremy Zucker. 

I've included links to the live website as well as to the music featured below.

My only hope for the website is that it may encourage a sense of calmness in whomever visits it, as it did for me.
